# knn_parallel_computation
KNN Parallel Computation  A high-performance implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using parallel computation to significantly reduce execution time for large datasets. This project demonstrates how parallelism (CPU multithreading / multiprocessing) can accelerate distance calculations and classification tasksl KNN
